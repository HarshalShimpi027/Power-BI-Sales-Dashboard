2. **Total Sales by Item Type:** Identifies the performance of different item types in terms of sales (Bar Chart).
3. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:** Compares total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content (Stacked Column Chart).
4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:** Evaluates the influence of outlet type/age on sales (Line Chart).
5. **Sales by Outlet Size:** Analyzes the correlation between outlet size and total sales (Donut/Pie Chart).
6. **Sales by Outlet Location:** Analyzes geographic distribution of sales (Funnel Map).
7. **All Metrics by Outlet Type:** Provides a comprehensive view of all key metrics by outlet type (Matrix Card).
